# Foundation-of-Business-Intelligence-Assignment
This is the assignment I worked on under Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate.  

For this assignment, I had to assume that i am working as business intelligence analyst for fictional company called "MarkIT". I was given a meeting note from my manager. in notes, everything details were mentioned, which i needed to prepare some documents before start working on any business intelligence tool, which is very import step.

the notes given by a manager ( fictinal scenario ) had stakeholders information, project requirememts, what company wants to achieve from a tool and questions to be answered after project is over. and i got a change to work preparing stakeholders requirements document, project requirement document and strategy document.
