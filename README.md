# Foundation-of-Business-Intelligence-Assignment
I completed this assignment as part of the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate, where I took on the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst at a fictitious company named "MarkIT."

In the assignment, I was provided with meeting notes from my manager, which contained comprehensive details crucial for preparing various documents before initiating work on any business intelligence toolâ€”a vital step in the process.

The notes from my manager (in this fictional scenario) included information about the stakeholders, the project's requirements, the company's objectives for the tool, and the questions that needed to be addressed upon the project's completion. I had the opportunity to work on preparing the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirement Document, and Strategy Document, ensuring all necessary preparations were made for the successful execution of the project.
